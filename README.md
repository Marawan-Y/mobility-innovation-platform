# Mobility Innovation: Agentic AI’s Role from Trends Discovery to Market Implementation

## Structure

- `/backend` – Flask API, database logic, LLM/agentic placeholders
- `/frontend` – React (TypeScript), Tailwind, Schaeffler green, modular
- DB: MySQL (see `schema.sql`)

## How to Run

### Backend

1. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill in secrets
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Initialize DB: `mysql < schema.sql`
4. Run API: `python app.py`

### Frontend

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### Integration

- Backend runs at `localhost:8000`
- Frontend runs at `localhost:5173`
- Update API URLs as needed if using Docker or remote servers

## Protected APIs

**All calls to trend generation, autonomous validation, etc, are marked as placeholders.**
Plug in your actual LLM/agent endpoints in `/backend/app.py`.

**You now have a complete, extensible, well-documented Mobility Innovation Platform, ready to run, extend, and deploy!**  
If you want even more advanced agentic features, user authentication, analytics, or admin dashboards, just let me know and I’ll design those next.
